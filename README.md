# scrabble_engine
Scrabble coded from scratch and a Neural Network based engine to predict the best next moves.

To play scrabble, simply run game_main.py. You will have to follow the directions in the terminal and enter inputs in the terminal. I plan to change this in the future to being able to play the game fully from the pygame window.

Current limited to 2 players

Currently both players hands are visible to all players
