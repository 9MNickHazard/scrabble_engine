# scrabble_engine
Scrabble coded from scratch, an algorithm to show all valid moves, and a Deep Q Learning based engine (to come in the near future) to predict the best next moves (next best moves in Scrabble are not always just the top scoring move).

To play scrabble, simply run game_main.py. You will have to follow the directions in the terminal and enter inputs in the terminal. I plan to change this in the future to being able to play the game fully from the pygame window.

Current limited to 2 players

Currently both players hands are visible to all players
